Currently seeking a dual career to develop my technical skills in network and system security, I aim to strengthen my expertise in these areas while deepening my understanding of the legal issues related to cybersecurity. My professional goal is to become a cybersecurity lawyer, combining technical and legal skills to meet today’s digital security challenges.
